     * Indicates whether if anything is actually updated in the origin of

     *
     * <p><b>VERY VERY IMPORTANT:</b> This method is to be called only from
     * a single thread or concurrency issues will arise.</p>
     *
     * <p>Why? To check and see if it's updatable, a source might ask it's
     * origin (a web url?) to get the new content, to compare with the old
     * content, and it asks it's origin for the new content once more, to
     * actually update the values. If this method is called during
     * KonfigurationKombiner is also calling it, this might interfere and
     * lost updates may happen.</p>
     *
     * <p>To help blocking issues, update() is allowed to block the current
     * thread, and update observers will continue to work in their own
     * thread. This mechanism also helps to notify them only after when
     * <em>all</em> the combined sources are updated.</p>
     *
     * <p>NOT Thread-safe.

     * differ from this source.
